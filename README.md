# pilgrim

Pilgrim project is IntelliJ IDEA plugin for search history and navigation support.

Main project idea is quite simple. We search through many lines of legacy code while we develop.
Some search results are irrelevant, and for some of them we go deeper. And more deeper.
And, if those result are irrelevant too, we must go back.
And it is difficult to remember all of searhes we had done.
So, it's great to have an instrument to manage our searches and to link them with each other.
This is also useful for complex refactoring and reengineering, when it's risky to forget something.

Resume our main ideas:
1) Link searches into tree (each search result may produce some more searches).
2) Manage our searches and save them for some time.
